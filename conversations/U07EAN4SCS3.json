So far, the other student has developed a couple rough outlines (more like short tutorials). I took one of them and fleshed it out to be a more complete lecture, rehearsing it, etc. I think I want them to do more work on the other one, but it's kind of difficult for me to communicate about how they should go about doing so. I was thinking the main thing I can do is just \"perform\" the lecture for them today, which we're going to do around 11am. That way, they can really see what I had in mind (and also give me feedback!). The other thing I was thinking is that I might take the lecture I fleshed out and just go through and write bullet points of each piece of information that it communicates. I don't know exactly how to articulate why I feel it's important, but i think at least we might use that after our user study, during analysis. Basically, if we quantize each bit of information in the lecture, then when we look at student notes (produced during the study) and design quizzes (for the user study) we can look back at the pieces of information to see what's missing, etc."
